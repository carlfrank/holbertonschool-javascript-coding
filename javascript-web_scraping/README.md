# Node.js Basics - Holberton School JavaScript Coding

## Overview

This repository is part of the Holberton School curriculum focused on JavaScript coding, particularly covering the basics of Node.js. It serves as an introduction to server-side JavaScript, exploring Node.js fundamentals, asynchronous programming, HTTP server creation, working with file systems, and more. This project aims to equip students with the knowledge required to build simple, efficient back-end services and applications using Node.js.

## Features

- **Node.js Fundamentals**: Exercises and examples covering the core concepts of Node.js.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Demonstrations of Node.js's non-blocking I/O model through practical exercises.
- **HTTP Servers**: Step-by-step guides to creating basic HTTP servers, handling requests, and sending responses.
- **File System Operations**: Examples of reading from and writing to files in a Node.js application.
- **Modules and Packages**: Introduction to modular programming in Node.js using `require`, `module.exports`, and working with npm packages.

## Prerequisites

Before you start working with the Node.js basics project, you should have the following installed:

- Node.js (latest stable version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom)
